				I studied at Cesar Vallejo University, where I not only focused on my
				major in Systems Engineering but also made the most of my university
				experience. I actively participated in various extracurricular
				activities, such as student clubs and sports events, which allowed me to
				meet other students with similar interests and develop additional
				skills. Additionally, I had the opportunity to engage in research
				projects, which enabled me to acquire research skills and stay up to
				date with the latest trends in my field. Attending conferences and
				seminars was another integral part of my experience as it allowed me to
				learn from experts in the field and establish valuable connections.
